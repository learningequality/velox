# Velox

Velox is a tool used to measure how [Kolibri](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) responds to stress testing.

## Goal

As Kolibri keeps evolving at a fast pace, a need arises to synchronously concentrate on the performance aspects of the tool i.e. its ability to serve as many clients as possible with respect to the underlying hardware specifications.

Thus, the main goals of Velox tool are:
- ability to set up reproducible tests to simulate various Kolibri use-case scenarios
- ability to measure the performance of the scenarios

## Installation

Velox needs Python 3.5+
